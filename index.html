            Hello, and welcome to my resume webpage! Everything that you will need to know about my life, 
            interests and my work experience is depicted on this webpage. To give you some background, I 
            immigrated to the United States when I was 9 years old. I didnâ€™t know English, or what America 
            really was, all I knew is that I came to an amazing place. 
            Throughout my whole life I have spent my time trying to establish myself and my family here in the 
            Bay Area. As a first generation immigrant I faced many challenges like learning to speak English, 
            making friends and identifying myself as a person. 
            Now I feel that I am an American citizen and truly belong in this country. However if you decide 
            to hire me, I will give you all of my full effort like I was raised to do.
